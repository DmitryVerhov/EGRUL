This class is used to parse data from egrul.nalog.ru, a Russian government website. The init method initializes the class by generating headers, setting the home and search URLs, and creating empty lists for data and wrong numbers. 
The try_post and try_get methods are used to make requests to the website with retry logic in case of failure. The check_numbers method takes a list or tuple of numbers as an argument and uses the try_post and try_get methods to make requests for each number in the list. If there is client info available, it is added to the data list, otherwise it is added to the wrong numbers list. A progress bar is also displayed while processing each number.
